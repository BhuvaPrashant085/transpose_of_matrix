# Transpose of a Square Matrix (Python)

This project demonstrates how to find the **transpose of a square matrix** using Python.  
The program takes matrix input from the user, validates the input, and performs an **in-place transpose** using element swapping.

## 📌 Features

- Accepts only **positive integers** for matrix dimensions
- Works **only for square matrices (N × N)**
- Handles invalid input using `try-except`
- Uses **in-place transpose logic** (no extra matrix required)
- Beginner-friendly and well-structured code

## 🧠 Concept Used

The **transpose of a matrix** is obtained by swapping elements across the main diagonal:
